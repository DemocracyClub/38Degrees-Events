The meeting will finish not later than 10.00 pm.\r Whether or not you are able to come to the meeting, it would be really helpful if you could submit your questions in advance, to ensure that we can have a balanced, constructive evening.

Youssef will help us understand the frightening truth of what's really been happening.\r Meet at 6.30pm for a 7pm start. Presentation approx. 1 hour.

Officials in Brussels have said that our NHS is protected from TTIP - but leaked documents show that\u2019s not true. TTIP would allow corporations to sue us for our democratically taken decisions.

        "description": "This is a notice for an action outside the offices of Which?, the UK consumer organisation , on Friday lunchtime April 17th 12.30-2pm. It is about Which? support for TTIP, which means the organisation is allowing itself to be used by the promoters of TTIP to say that 'consumers' support TTIP, when in fact TTIP will be devastating for consumers.\r Changing that position of support to one or opposition would undermine TTIP. \r Why target 'WHICH?\u2019 the UK consumer organisation?\r \u2022\tBecause 'Which?' is still supporting TTIP (the US/EU Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) despite the agreement's clear, overall negative impact on consumers.\r\u2022\tSo supporting an agreement with high risks to consumer health and safety, including in relation to chemicals and food, and to financial service regulation, for some possible lower prices \u2013 if companies pass savings on to consumers.\r\u2022\t'Which?', in its organisational practice, does not make consumer assessments purely on lowest prices. Why do so with TTIP?\r\u2022\tThe position of UK 'Which?' is a main factor holding back the EU umbrella consumer organisation, BEUC, from opposing TTIP. \r\u2022\tThis position allows pro-TTIP forces, like the EC Commission and the UK business department (BIS) to assert that TTIP is supported by consumers - a useful tool for them when there are few tools available to promote the agreement.\r\u2022\t'Which?' does NOT represent all consumers, in fact their subscription base is likely to be demographically quite narrow. However, it suits both pro TTIP forces and 'Which?' to be presented as being broadly representative of consumers.  \r\u2022\tThe campaigning that 'Which?' does on issues that affect people more broadly are contradicted by its  support for a deregulatory agreement that will boost corporations' rights and reduce states' abilities to control corporations.\r",
